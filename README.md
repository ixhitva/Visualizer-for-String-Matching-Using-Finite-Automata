# String Matching Visualizer using Finite Automata

Preview: [Visualizer Tool for string matching using finite automata](https://visualizer-for-string-matching-8rzh.vercel.app/) <3

## Overview

This project is a **String Matching Visualizer** built using **ReactJS**, which demonstrates how the **Finite Automata** concept works for string matching. The tool provides a step-by-step visualization of the string matching process, making it easier to understand how this algorithm functions.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Visualizer**: Visualizes the finite automata's state transitions as it processes a string.
- **Informative Resources**: Learn about the underlying theory of finite automata and its role in pattern searching algorithms.
- **Reference Videos**: Includes links to relevant videos explaining the concepts in detail.
- **Quiz**: Test your understanding with quizzes based on finite automata and string matching concepts.

## How This Tool is Helpful
- **Educational Resource**: Ideal for students, researchers, or professionals looking to explore string matching techniques.
- **Interactive Learning**: The visualizer and quiz encourage hands-on learning and provide real-time feedback.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Along with the visualizer, the app includes theory, videos, and quizzes for a complete learning experience.
