        <p className="Main">String Matching</p>
        <p className="inside">
          String matching is a process of finding one or more occurrences of a
          substring (pattern) within a larger string (text). This can be done
          either for exact matches, where the substring must match the text
          exactly, or approximate matches, where some differences or errors are
          allowed between the substring and the text. String matching is a
          fundamental operation in computer science, used in text processing,
          search engines, bioinformatics, and many other fields.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p className="inside">
          String matching is essential because it enables efficient searching
          and manipulation of text data.
          <br />
          It is widely used in: <br />
          <b>1. Search Engines:</b> To find relevant documents or information
          based on user queries. <br />
          <b>2. Text Editing:</b> To perform find-and-replace operations. <br />
          <b>3. Bioinformatics:</b> To identify sequences of DNA or proteins.{" "}
          <br />
          <b>4. Data Retrieval:</b> To extract specific information from large
          datasets. <br />
          <b>5. Plagiarism Detection:</b> To compare texts for similarities.{" "}
          <br />
          In essence, string matching is crucial for any application that
          involves processing and analyzing textual information.

        <p className="Main">Native Method of String Matching</p>
        <p className="inside">
          The native method of string matching, often referred to as the
          brute-force approach, involves checking every possible position in the
          text to see if the pattern matches. Here’s how it works:
        </p>
        <p className="inside">
          <strong>Alignment:</strong> Align the pattern at the beginning of the
          text.
          <br />
          <strong>Comparison:</strong> Compare the pattern with the substring of
          the text starting at the current position.
          <br />
          <strong>Shift:</strong> Move the pattern one position to the right and
          repeat the comparison.
          <br />
          <strong>Repeat:</strong> Continue this process until the end of the
          text is reached.

        <p className="Main">Finite Automata in String Matching</p>
        <p className="inside">
          Finite automata are used in string matching for several reasons:
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>1. Efficiency:</strong> They allow for linear time string
          matching, making them faster for large texts compared to naive
          methods.
          <br />
          <strong>2. Determinism:</strong> The deterministic nature ensures
          predictable performance and consistency in matching.
          <br />
          <strong>3. Preprocessing:</strong> Once the automaton is built, it can
          be reused for multiple searches, making it efficient for repeated
          queries.
          <br />
          <strong>4. Versatility:</strong> They can be extended to handle
          various string matching problems, including patterns with wildcards
          and regular expressions.

          <div className="inside">
            <h4>Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> In a DFA, each state has exactly one
              transition for each possible input symbol.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Characteristics: There is only one possible state to move to for
                each input symbol. No ambiguity in state transitions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Usage: Preferred for applications where deterministic behavior
                is required, such as lexical analysis in compilers.
              </li>

          <div className="inside">
            <h4>Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)</h4>
            <p>
              <strong>Definition:</strong> In an NFA, each state can have zero,
              one, or multiple transitions for each possible input symbol.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Characteristics: Can move to any combination of next states for
                a given input symbol. May include ε (epsilon) transitions, which
                allow the automaton to move to a new state without consuming any
                input symbols.
              </li>
              <li>
                Usage:Easier to construct for complex patterns and can be
                converted to an equivalent DFA for practical implementation.

          <h2>Finite Automata in String Matching</h2>

          <div className="inside">
            <p>
              Finite automata are preferred in string matching for several
              reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Efficiency:</strong> After an initial preprocessing step
                to build the automaton, the matching process runs in linear time
                relative to the text length, making it very fast.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Consistency:</strong> DFAs provide deterministic
                behavior, ensuring that the same input will always result in the
                same state transitions, which is crucial for reliable matching.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Reusability:</strong> Once constructed, a finite
                automaton can be reused for multiple searches on different
                texts, saving time in applications where the same pattern needs
                to be matched repeatedly.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Flexibility:</strong> NFAs are easier to construct for
                complex patterns and can handle more intricate matching
                requirements, such as patterns with multiple possible
                transitions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Foundation for Advanced Techniques:</strong> Finite
                automata are foundational in theoretical computer science and
                serve as a basis for more advanced string matching algorithms
                and techniques.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Overall, the combination of speed, reliability, and flexibility
              makes finite automata a robust choice for string matching tasks.
